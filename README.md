Fiberator
=========

Some messing around with Elixir.
This is simply a Fibonacci calculator with memoization and a text based file cache for saving results between instances.

To compile use mix:

`mix escript.build`

To run:

`./fiberator`


## To Do/Problems:

* Way to much passing around that cache_pid variable :-(
* Not very functional in flow.
* Some simpler chain than used in the current file parsing function?
* Tests for the fiberator main.
* ...
